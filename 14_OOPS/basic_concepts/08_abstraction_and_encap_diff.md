# what is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation ?

Great question! **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** are two fundamental OOP concepts in C++ (and Java too), and they’re often confused because they’re related but serve different purposes. Let’s break them down clearly:

---

## **1. Abstraction**

* **Definition:**
  Hiding **implementation details** and showing only the **essential features** to the user.

* **Focus:**
  *What the object does* (behavior) rather than *how it does it*.

* **Achieved by:**

  * **Abstract classes** (pure virtual functions in C++).
  * **Interfaces** (in Java).
  * Using **function declarations without implementation details**.

* **Goal:**

  * Provide a **simplified view** of the object.
  * Separate **interface from implementation**.

---

### **Example of Abstraction in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Abstract class (pure virtual function)
class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0;  // Pure virtual function (interface)
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle\n";
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shape = new Circle();
    shape->draw(); // User doesn't care how Circle draws itself
    delete shape;
}
```

Here, the user knows **what** `draw()` does, not **how** Circle implements it.

## **2. Encapsulation**

* **Definition:**
  Binding **data (variables)** and **functions (methods)** into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some components.

* **Focus:**
  *How the object hides its internal state* and provides controlled access via **getters/setters**.

* **Achieved by:**

  * **Access specifiers**: `private`, `protected`, `public`.
  * Wrapping data and behavior inside a class.

* **Goal:**

  * **Protect data integrity**.
  * Control access to internal representation.

### **Example of Encapsulation in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Account {
private:
    double balance; // Hidden data (encapsulation)

public:
    void deposit(double amount) { balance += amount; }
    double getBalance() const { return balance; }
};

int main() {
    Account acc;
    acc.deposit(1000); 
    cout << acc.getBalance(); // Access through public methods only
}
```

Here, `balance` is protected from direct modification, ensuring controlled access.

## **Key Differences Between Abstraction and Encapsulation**

| Feature         | Abstraction                     | Encapsulation                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Definition**  | Hides implementation details    | Hides internal data (state)          |
| **Focus**       | *What* an object does           | *How* an object’s data is protected  |
| **Achieved by** | Abstract classes, interfaces    | Classes, access specifiers           |
| **Purpose**     | Show only relevant info to user | Restrict unauthorized access         |
| **User View**   | Specifies behavior              | Protects state and ensures integrity |

### **Simple Analogy**

* **Abstraction** = Using a **TV remote**: You know buttons (interface) but not the internal circuitry (implementation).
* **Encapsulation** = The **TV casing**: It hides all internal wires and protects them from external interference.
