# what is virtual constructor and destructor ?

Great question! The terms **virtual constructor** and **virtual destructor** in C++ often confuse learners because **constructors and destructors behave differently with respect to virtual functions**. Let me clarify each:

---

## **1. Virtual Constructor in C++**

### **Does C++ have virtual constructors?**

* **NO.** C++ does **not allow constructors to be virtual**.
* Reason:

  * Constructors are responsible for **creating objects** and **initializing the vtable** (for virtual function calls).
  * Making them virtual would require a vtable before the object is created — which is impossible.

---

### **Then what is meant by "Virtual Constructor"?**

* It’s a **design pattern (not a language feature)**.
* The term refers to using **factory methods** (often static) that return a **pointer to a base class object**, allowing creation of derived objects **polymorphically**.

#### **Example: Virtual Constructor Pattern**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base class\n"; }
    static Base* create(int type);  // Acts like a "virtual constructor"
};

class Derived1 : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived1 class\n"; }
};

class Derived2 : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived2 class\n"; }
};

// Factory method implementation
Base* Base::create(int type) {
    if (type == 1) return new Derived1();
    else return new Derived2();
}

int main() {
    Base* obj = Base::create(1); // "Virtual constructor"
    obj->show();                 // Output: Derived1 class
    delete obj;
}
```

---

# **2. Virtual Destructor in C++**

### **What is a Virtual Destructor?**

* A **destructor declared with `virtual` keyword** in a base class.
* Ensures that when you delete a derived object through a **base class pointer**, the **derived class destructor is also called**.

---

### **Why do we need it?**

* Without a virtual destructor, only the **base class destructor** runs, potentially causing **memory leaks** (derived class resources are not freed).

---

### **Example Without Virtual Destructor (Problem)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    ~Base() { cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* ptr = new Derived();
    delete ptr;   // Only Base destructor called ❌
}
```

**Output:**

```
Base destructor
```

Derived destructor is skipped → memory/resource leak!

---

### **Example With Virtual Destructor (Solution)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    virtual ~Base() { cout << "Base destructor\n"; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    ~Derived() { cout << "Derived destructor\n"; }
};

int main() {
    Base* ptr = new Derived();
    delete ptr;   // Both destructors called ✅
}
```

**Output:**

```
Derived destructor
Base destructor
```

---

## **Key Points**

### **Virtual Constructor**

* Not supported in language (cannot mark `constructor` as virtual).
* Achieved via **factory methods or clone methods**.
* Purpose: **Create objects polymorphically**.

### **Virtual Destructor**

* Supported and essential for polymorphism.
* Ensures **proper cleanup** of derived objects when deleting via base pointer.
