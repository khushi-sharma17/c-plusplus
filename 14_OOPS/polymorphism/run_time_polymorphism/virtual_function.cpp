/*
- You cannot create an object of an abstract class.
- You must override all pure virtual functions in the derived class to make it concrete.
- Abstract classes enable runtime polymorphism and hide complexity from the user.
- At runtime, check the actual type of object and call the correct function.
*/


/*
- So, what does virtual do?
- It enables runtime polymorphism â€” meaning:
- Even if you're using a pointer/reference to a base class, C++ will dynamically choose the correct function of the derived class at runtime.


In one sentence:
- We use virtual functions when we want different derived classes to have their own versions of a function, and still call them through a common base class pointer or reference.

/*

In C++, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is intended to be used as a base class. It typically serves as an interface or a common base for derived classes.
Key Characteristics of Abstract Classes:

--> Contains at least one pure virtual function.
--> Cannot be instantiated directly.
--> Must be inherited and the pure virtual functions must be implemented by derived classes (unless the derived class is also abstract).


*/




/*
In C++: All interfaces are abstract classes, but not all abstract classes are interfaces.
- Interface = abstract class with only pure virtual functions (no implementation).
- Abstract class = can mix pure virtual + normal functions (partial implementation possible).
